			<h4>Symphony No. 40 in G minor, KV. 550 was written by Wolfgang Amadeus
			Mozart in 1788. It is sometimes referred to as the "Great G minor symphony," 
			to distinguish it from the "Little G minor symphony," No. 25. The two 
			are the only extant minor key symphonies Mozart wrote.[1]</h4>
			<h4>The date of completion of this symphony is known exactly, since Mozart
			in his mature years kept a full catalog of his completed works; he entered
			the 40th Symphony into it on 25 July 1788.[2] Work on the symphony occupied
			an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks during which time
			he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26 June and 10 August,
			respectively).[3] Nikolaus Harnoncourt conjectured that Mozart composed 
			the three symphonies as a unified work, pointing, among other things, 
			to the fact that the Symphony No. 40, as the middle work, has no 
			introduction (unlike No. 39) and does not have a finale of the 
			scale of <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline; font-size:30px" onclick="curious()">No. 41's.</span>

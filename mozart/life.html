					<h3>Early life</h3>
					<p><h4>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to
					Leopold Mozart (1719–1787) and Anna Maria, née Pertl (1720–1778), at 9 
					Getreidegasse in Salzburg.When Nannerl was 7, she began keyboard lessons 
					with her father, while her 3-year-old brother looked on. Years later,
					after her brother's death, she reminisced:He often spent much time at the 
					clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure 
					showed that it sounded good.... In the fourth year of his age his father, 
					for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the 
					clavier.... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and 
					keeping exactly in time.... At the age of five, he was already composing
					little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.[10]</h4>

					<h3>Journey to Paris</h3>
					<p><h4>In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg[30] and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.[31]
						Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in 
						Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love 
						with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. 
						There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to 
						nothing,[32] and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778[33] to 
						continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a 
						possible post as an organist at<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=194CDlsFpQA"> Versailles </a> 
						but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment.</h4>

					<h3 style="text-align:left">Travel</h3> 
					<p><h4>During Mozart's youth, his family made several European journeys in which he 
					and Nannerl performed as child prodigies. <img style="float:right" src="images/800px-thumbnail.jpg" alt="mozart violine" width="100px" height="150px"> 
					These began with an exhibition in 1762
					at the court of Prince-elector Maximilian III of Bavaria in Munich, and at the
					Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague.A long concert tour followed, spanning three
					and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, Mannheim, Paris, London,[15]
					The Hague, again to Paris, and back home via Zurich, Donaueschingen, and Munich.
